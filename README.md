Photo_Mover
===========

Photo Mover for moving photos from a single directory structure to multi level based on date taken.

### Requirements
This script requires you to run a Windows operating system.

### Installation:
Download the file from https://github.com/dagalufh/Photo_Mover/releases and place it anywhere you like and run it.

### Usage:
Upon starting the vbs file, you as a user are asked to specify the source where photos are located. It will search through all the subdirectories for photos.

After that, you are asked about the target directory. There are keywords available that is year, month and day. These will be replaced with the dates from the photo in question. (based on Date Taken property)

Then the script starts creating directories as needed and moves photos. A log file is created in the source directory showing what has been done.

As this moves photos and reorganizes them, use this at your own risk.
